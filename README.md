This is my project for HackUMass. We have automated job allotment for UMass Dining Commons. This software can be modified slightly and can be used for any other such companies. We have also kept in mind the pandemic which is going on. We have used Google Cloud to store data.

# UMassFight Covid Dining Jobs - HackUMass Project 

General :
Managing people is one of the hardest responsibilities for any person. A company’s manager has to take care of its employees and also has to make sure that everything is working seamlessly. 
As students who have worked at UMass Dining, we have seen the difficulties faced by the managers. With the help of this software/web application we have tried to reduce that burden. This web application is not just limited to working for UMass Dining but with some modifications it can work just as well for other companies. This clearly is one of the simplest uses of automation to simplify, in this scenario, the distribution of jobs. 

Code Explanation:
This web application is built using HTML, CSS, JS and Google Cloud. 

When a user opens the website for the first time, they are required to register/create an account. If it is an existing user, they can directly sign into their account. All the necessary information of the user is stored using the Google Firebase Real Time Database. 
Every morning, using the master password, the manager can reset the jobs available and the employees must fill out a questionnaire. 
The questionnaire has three basic questions that every employee must answer for the protection of other employees and themselves. It is created keeping the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. 
Once the questionnaire is filled, the user gets an alert if they get the job for the day or if they do not (no vacancies or probably if they’re not well). 
All this data is stored in the Firebase Database and can be seen by the manager whenever he wishes.
